.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The “cmake” executable is the CMake command\-line interface.  It may be
used to configure projects in scripts.  Project configuration settings
may be specified on the command line with the \-D option.
.sp
CMake is a cross\-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform\-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-S <path\-to\-source>\fP
Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.
.TP
.B \fB\-B <path\-to\-build>\fP
Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.
.sp
If the directory doesn’t already exist CMake will make it.
.TP
.B \fB\-C <initial\-cache>\fP
Pre\-load a script to populate the cache.
.sp
When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for
the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which
to load cache entries before the first pass through the project’s
cmake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the
project’s default values.  The given file should be a CMake script
containing SET commands that use the CACHE option, not a
cache\-format file.
.TP
.B \fB\-D <var>:<type>=<value>, \-D <var>=<value>\fP
Create or update a cmake cache entry.
.sp
When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for
the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that
takes priority over the project’s default value.  The option may be
repeated for as many cache entries as desired.
.sp
If the \fB:<type>\fP portion is given it must be one of the types
specified by the \fBset()\fP command documentation for its
\fBCACHE\fP signature.
If the \fB:<type>\fP portion is omitted the entry will be created
with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a
command in the project sets the type to \fBPATH\fP or \fBFILEPATH\fP
then the \fB<value>\fP will be converted to an absolute path.
.sp
This option may also be given as a single argument:
\fB\-D<var>:<type>=<value>\fP or \fB\-D<var>=<value>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-U <globbing_expr>\fP
Remove matching entries from CMake cache.
.sp
This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the
CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ? are
supported.  The option may be repeated for as many cache entries as
desired.
.sp
Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non\-working.
.TP
.B \fB\-G <generator\-name>\fP
Specify a build system generator.
.sp
CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain
platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating a particular
build system.  Possible generator names are specified in the
\fBcmake\-generators(7)\fP manual.
.TP
.B \fB\-T <toolset\-spec>\fP
Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.
.sp
Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell
the native build system how to choose a compiler.  See the
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET\fP variable for details.
.TP
.B \fB\-A <platform\-name>\fP
Specify platform name if supported by generator.
.sp
Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the
native build system to choose a compiler or SDK.  See the
\fBCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM\fP variable for details.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-dev\fP
Suppress developer warnings.
.sp
Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the
CMakeLists.txt files. By default this will also turn off
deprecation warnings.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wdev\fP
Enable developer warnings.
.sp
Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt
files. By default this will also turn on deprecation warnings.
.TP
.B \fB\-Werror=dev\fP
Make developer warnings errors.
.sp
Make warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files
errors. By default this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-error=dev\fP
Make developer warnings not errors.
.sp
Make warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files not
errors. By default this will also turn off deprecated warnings as errors.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wdeprecated\fP
Enable deprecated functionality warnings.
.sp
Enable warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-deprecated\fP
Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.
.sp
Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.
.TP
.B \fB\-Werror=deprecated\fP
Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.
.sp
Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant
for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files, errors.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-error=deprecated\fP
Make deprecated macro and function warnings not errors.
.sp
Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant
for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files, not errors.
.TP
.B \fB\-E <command> [<options>...]\fP
See \fI\%Command\-Line Tool Mode\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-L[A][H]\fP
List non\-advanced cached variables.
.sp
List cache variables will run CMake and list all the variables from
the CMake cache that are not marked as INTERNAL or ADVANCED.  This
will effectively display current CMake settings, which can then be
changed with \-D option.  Changing some of the variables may result
in more variables being created.  If A is specified, then it will
display also advanced variables.  If H is specified, it will also
display help for each variable.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-build <dir>\fP
See \fI\%Build Tool Mode\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-open <dir>\fP
Open the generated project in the associated application.  This is
only supported by some generators.
.TP
.B \fB\-N\fP
View mode only.
.sp
Only load the cache.  Do not actually run configure and generate
steps.
.TP
.B \fB\-P <file>\fP
Process script mode.
.sp
Process the given cmake file as a script written in the CMake
language.  No configure or generate step is performed and the cache
is not modified.  If variables are defined using \-D, this must be
done before the \-P argument.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-find\-package\fP
See \fI\%Find\-Package Tool Mode\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-graphviz=[file]\fP
Generate graphviz of dependencies, see \fBCMakeGraphVizOptions\fP for more.

Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the library and
executable dependencies in the project.  See the documentation for
\fBCMakeGraphVizOptions\fP for more details.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-system\-information [file]\fP
Dump information about this system.
.sp
Dump a wide range of information about the current system.  If run
from the top of a binary tree for a CMake project it will dump
additional information such as the cache, log files etc.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-debug\-trycompile\fP
Do not delete the try_compile build tree. Only useful on one try_compile at a time.
.sp
Do not delete the files and directories created for try_compile
calls.  This is useful in debugging failed try_compiles.  It may
however change the results of the try\-compiles as old junk from a
previous try\-compile may cause a different test to either pass or
fail incorrectly.  This option is best used for one try\-compile at a
time, and only when debugging.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-debug\-output\fP
Put cmake in a debug mode.
.sp
Print extra information during the cmake run like stack traces with
message(send_error ) calls.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-trace\-source=<file>\fP
Put cmake in trace mode, but output only lines of a specified file.
.sp
Multiple options are allowed.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-warn\-uninitialized\fP
Warn about uninitialized values.
.sp
Print a warning when an uninitialized variable is used.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-warn\-unused\-vars\fP
Warn about unused variables.

used.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-check\-system\-vars\fP
Find problems with variable usage in system files.
.sp
Normally, unused and uninitialized variables are searched for only
in CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.  This flag tells CMake to
warn about other files as well.

.SH FIND-PACKAGE TOOL MODE
.sp
CMake provides a helper for Makefile\-based projects with the signature:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cmake \-\-find\-package <options>...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This runs in a pkg\-config like mode.
.sp
Search a package using \fBfind_package()\fP and print the resulting flags
to stdout.  This can be used to use cmake instead of pkg\-config to find
installed libraries in plain Makefile\-based projects or in autoconf\-based
projects (via \fBshare/aclocal/cmake.m4\fP).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This mode is not well\-supported due to some technical limitations.
It is kept for compatibility but should not be used in new projects.
